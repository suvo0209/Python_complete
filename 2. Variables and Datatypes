print("Hello Python world!")
When you run this code, you should see this output:
Hello Python world!
As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that print is the name of a function and displays that word in blue. It recognizes 
that “Hello Python world!” is not Python code and displays that phrase in orange. This feature is called syntax highlighting and is quite useful as you start to write your own programs.
Variables:
Every variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable.
Eg. message = "Hello Python world!"
    print(message)
Here 'message' is a variable that holds the string "Hello Python World!"
Now, a variable can have different tyhpes of datatypes. Lets say in the above case rhe datatype is a string datatype, it can also be an integer, a float and so on...
Lets take another example:
 message = "Hello Python world!"
 print(message)
 message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
 print(message)
Now when you run hello_world.py, you should see two lines of output:
 Hello Python world! 
 Hello Python Crash Course world!
Strings:
A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this: 
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
Changing Case in a String with Methods
One of the simplest tasks you can do with strings is change the case of the words in a string.
Input: name = "ada lovelace"
       print(name.title())
Output: Ada Lovelace
Input:  name = "Ada Lovelace"
                print(name.upper())
                print(name.lower())
Output:         ADA LOVELACE
                ada lovelace
Combining or Concatenating Strings
It’s often useful to combine strings. For example, you might want to store a first name and a last name in separate variables, and then combine them when you want to display someone’s full name:
Input: first_name = "ada"
       last_name = "lovelace"
       full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
       print(full_name)
Output:  ada lovelace
Input:  first_name = "ada"
        last_name = "lovelace"
        full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
        message = "Hello, " + full_name.title() + "!"
        print(message)
Output:  “Hello, Ada Lovelace!”
Numbers
Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games, represent data in visualizations, store information in web applications, and so on. Python treats numbers in several different ways.
 Integers
 You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python. 
 2+5, 4-2, 7*5, 9/3 ..... are some mathematical operations with intehers.
 Floats
Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number. 
2.0+5.0, 4.0-2.0, 7.8*5.3, 9.00/3.00 ..... are some mathematical operations with floats.
