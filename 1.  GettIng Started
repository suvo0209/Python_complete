Running Python Programs from a terminal
Most of the programs you write in your text editor you’ll run directly from the editor, but sometimes it’s useful to run programs from a terminal instead. For example, you might want to run an existing program
without opening it for editing. 
You can do this on any system with Python installed if you know how to access the directory where you’ve stored your program file.
